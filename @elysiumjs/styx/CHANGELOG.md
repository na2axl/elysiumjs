### Minor Changes

- [`8ac91ab`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/8ac91ab676b1119b4eecf0ddb3fd0a3e84017cac) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Upgrade dependencies to their latest major versions: wampy 8, zod 4, commander 15, @casl/ability 7, OpenTelemetry SDK 2 (sdk-node 0.300, resources 3), @sentry/bun 11. Generated projects now use TypeScript 7.

  Breaking in `@elysiumjs/mnemosyne-drizzle`: it now requires drizzle-orm 1.0 (release candidate) and generated projects use drizzle-kit 1.0. `ColumnsWithTable` is no longer re-exported. `migration:generate` writes 1.0 migration folders (`<timestamp>_<name>/migration.sql`), and `migration:run` tracks those by folder name while still running flat `*.sql` files. Existing projects can upgrade their migrations folder with `drizzle-kit up`: `migration:run` recognises the moved migrations as already applied and renames their records. The `make:model` stub now generates a `pgTable` and a `DrizzleModel` built from it.

  Breaking in `@elysiumjs/core`: the deprecated `@elysiajs/swagger` plugin is replaced by `@elysiajs/openapi`, and the app option `swagger` is renamed `openapi` (typed `ElysiaOpenAPIConfig | false`). Without a `path`, the docs now live at `/openapi` instead of `/swagger`. The UI options `scalarConfig` and `swaggerOptions` are now `scalar` and `swagger`. Elysia stays on 1.4 (now `^1.4.30`) until Elysia 2 and its OpenAPI plugin are stable.

  Also in `@elysiumjs/core`: the WAMP `onChallenge` callback must return a string (or a promise of one); `null` is no longer accepted. `onError` now receives the error and `onReconnectSuccess` receives wampy's details object. `WampClient` is now wampy's own `Wampy` type. `onOpen` is called by Elysium once the connection is established, since wampy 8 no longer has that callback.

- [`3625883`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/3625883dba92f1596e7444ee52f9399d8e9b049f) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Drop the `reflect-metadata` dependency. Decorator metadata now lives in a small store in `@elysiumjs/core`, exported as `Metadata` (`define`, `get`, `getOwn`, `has`). Use it instead of `Reflect.defineMetadata` and `Reflect.getMetadata` to read or write Elysium metadata.

  Apps no longer need `import 'reflect-metadata'` in their entrypoint, and generated projects leave it out. Keep `emitDecoratorMetadata` enabled: `@Service.inject()` and `@Command.arg()` still infer types from it. An app that loads `reflect-metadata` for another library keeps working; Elysium also reads the types stored there.

- [`07236b3`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/07236b386c2506590d74e8753ce847c1e184b3ee) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Introduce the module system. Modules are now the only way to register anything in an Elysium.js app. This is a breaking change with no compatibility layer.

  Breaking changes:

  - `@Module.register()` takes `imports`, `services`, `exports`, `controllers`, `commands`, `jobs`, `prefix` and `env`. Services are private to their module unless exported (or global). The `beforeRegister` and `afterRegister` hooks are replaced by `onInit`, `onServe` and `onDestroy`.
  - Configurable modules are bound with `with()`, for example `HermesModule.with({ level: 'debug' })`. `with()` accepts an object or a function.
  - Decorators only record metadata. Importing a file no longer registers commands, services or event wiring, and the side-effect imports of the packages are removed. List commands, jobs and services in the module that owns them.
  - `@Application.register()` no longer takes `database`, `redis`, `wamp` or `'elysium:hermes'`/`'elysium:cerberus'` keys. Use `DrizzleModule`, `RedisModule`, `WampModule`, `HermesModule` and `CerberusModule`. Package plugins are replaced by modules: add `SentryModule` instead of the `plugin()` function. `plugins` still accepts plain Elysia plugin factories.
  - Constructing an `Application` no longer runs it. Use `await App.start()`; `Application.testing()` boots a module graph for tests. The `styx` binary loads `src/app.ts` (or `index.ts`) and starts the exported application, so a project entry no longer needs to import commands.
  - The job system of core (`Job`, `Worker`, `WorkerPool`, `commandWork`) is removed. `@elysiumjs/heracles` is the only job system: extend its `Job`, list jobs in a module's `jobs`, declare queues with `HeraclesModule.with({ queues })`, and dispatch with `Heracles.dispatch()`.
  - `@elysiumjs/styx` ships `StyxModule`, active in development only. The `migration:generate` and `migration:run` commands move to `DrizzleModule` and are available in production.
  - `@elysiumjs/mnemosyne` ships `MnemosyneModule` for its caches (`redis: false` or `memory: false` opts out). `DrizzleModule` imports it.
  - New modules: `HephaestusModule`, `ArgusModule` (`serviceName` is required), `SentryModule` (needs a `dsn` or `SENTRY_DSN`) and `CerberusModule` (`getSubject` is required).
  - Module and service code throws typed errors (for example `InvalidModuleConfigError`) instead of exiting the process. `Application.run()` prints them and exits; command `run()` methods may still exit, and package plugin factories are unchanged.
  - `Application.register` merges subclass props over the parent's (own props, then own metadata, then parent, then defaults), and concatenates `modules` parent first. Previously defaults and parent values won, so `openapi` could not be enabled.
  - `Heracles.dispatch` starts a stopped queue on first use, so producers no longer start queues. `Queue.start()` is idempotent.
  - `create-elysium` generates apps that use modules, and adds Sentry and Hephaestus to the `modules` list.
  - `@Event.on`/`@Event.once` method listeners on classes in a loaded module's `services` or `controllers` are wired by the kernel and run in their module's context. Jobs, commands and middlewares are not wired, and an instance listener on a class that is not a service throws `EventListenerNotSupportedError`. Listeners on classes not listed in a loaded module no longer fire.
  - New typed errors: `CircularDependencyError` (services that depend on each other, in sync and async resolution), `DuplicateModuleNameError` (two different module classes sharing a name; module scopes and config tokens are name based) and `EventListenerNotSupportedError`.
  - Lazy boot contract: a CLI command initialises only its own module and that module's imports. Sync helpers such as `Database.getConnection()` work when the owning module's `onInit` is synchronous; otherwise they throw `ServiceNotReadyError` naming the module. Use `await Service.resolve()` or set `static boot = true` on the command.
