### Minor Changes

- [#5](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/5) [`557a3ca`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/557a3cab7af8053a8bab9944e492e5022d91aa82) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Core runs outside Bun. Environment variables, timers, the HTTP server, process exit and shutdown signals now come from a `Runtime` set with the new `runtime` option of `@Application.register()` or with `Runtime.use()`. Runtimes ship as packages, each exporting `runtime`: `@elysiumjs/runtime-bun`, `@elysiumjs/runtime-node` and `@elysiumjs/runtime-workers` (which also exports `createRuntime({ env })`).

  Breaking: an application needs a runtime (add `runtime` from `@elysiumjs/runtime-bun`), and `Redis` and `RedisModule` moved from core to the new `@elysiumjs/redis` package, which also accepts a `client` factory for runtimes without `Bun.RedisClient`.

  Console colours are plain ANSI codes instead of `Bun.color`, `node:readline` is loaded only when a prompt runs, and core's dist is built for the `node` target so `node:` imports keep their prefix. `check:runtime` scripts in core and runtime-workers fail when their bundles touch the `Bun` global.

  `create-elysium` gets a runtime step: it installs the chosen runtime package and sets it in the generated app. Bun is selectable today; Node.js and Cloudflare Workers are listed as coming later.

- [#13](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/13) [`1ea417e`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/1ea417e3583250bc2f975d795f398b7ff736115d) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Hardening of the runtimes, the container and the CLI, checked by a conformance suite that runs on Bun, Node.js and workerd.

  Breaking changes:

  - `Runtime` gains the required `argv()`, `write(stream, text)` and `terminal()` members: core reaches the host's arguments, output streams and terminal only through the runtime. Custom runtimes must implement them.
  - The third parameter of `InteractsWithConsole.write` is now `'stdout' | 'stderr'`.
  - The WebSocket options are narrowed to `idleTimeout`, `maxPayloadLength` and `perMessageDeflate`, and the `bun` WebSocket types are replaced by `ElysiumWebSocket`.
  - Redis connections are `RedisConnection`s, a port any Redis client can implement, instead of `Bun.RedisClient`.
  - `styx create @scope/name` creates the project in `name/`, and refuses project and module names with upper-case letters.
  - Queue handlers no longer reject the batch: after the handlers ran, each message is acked or retried on its own. `@Workers.queue(name, { each: true })` receives one message at a time, so a failure retries only that message.

  Fixes:

  - Request-scoped services are destroyed when the request ends, also on failure, and an async `onInit` is awaited. A second dispose of a request scope waits for the one in progress, so a Worker's `waitUntil` covers an async `onDestroy`.
  - A failed module or service `onInit` no longer breaks later requests: the boot is retried, and the module's event listeners are unwired.
  - `@elysiumjs/runtime-node` serves through `node:http`, keeping the Host header authoritative.
  - `styx create` validates names before creating files, ships `.gitignore`, declares the dependencies of created projects and imports their default controllers.

- [#14](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/14) [`0956186`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/0956186db0ca5a83c0a6636aeb2a4c81a0033de4) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - The request pipeline: problem details, exception filters, interceptors, typed configuration, HTTP security options and an HTTP test client, checked on Bun, Node.js, workerd and AOT-compiled Workers.

  Breaking changes:

  - Error responses are RFC 9457 problem details (`application/problem+json`). Request validation errors answer 422 with an `errors` list of JSON pointers (`problems.validationStatus: 400` keeps 400). Server errors only show their message and stack in development. Thrown statuses (`c.status(...)`) are sent as they are.
  - Client errors (4xx) are no longer reported to `onError`, the `elysium:error` event or the trace.
  - `Runtime.serve` may return a handle with `close()`, which the application calls on shutdown.
  - Request bodies are limited to 1 MiB by default (`http.bodyLimit`), also when chunked.
  - The environment schema is validated when the app is built or run, with every error reported at once, instead of in the constructor.

  Features:

  - `DomainError`, with `status`, `type`, `title`, `detail` and extensions, and shortcuts such as `DomainError.notFound()`.
  - Exception filters (`@Catch()`, `filters` on routes, controllers, modules and the app) and interceptors (`interceptors` on the same levels), with `TimingInterceptor`, `TransformInterceptor` and mnemosyne's `CacheInterceptor`.
  - Typed configuration: `Secret` values, module `envSchema`s merged into the app's, `InvalidEnvironmentError`.
  - `http` options: CORS, security headers, body limits and trusted proxies (`ctx.ip`). Runtimes report the client address through `clientAddress`.
  - `createTestingHttpApp` and `createHttpClient` send requests to an app in memory, with `expectStatus()`.

  Fixes:

  - App-level `onRequest` middlewares run in the request scope.
  - On Workers, the request scope of a streamed response is disposed when the body ends, not when `fetch` returns.
  - `KeyvWorkersKV.clear()` stays within an operation budget (`maxOperations`).
  - The Node.js bridge treats a destroyed socket as a client abort.
  - Heracles performance metrics report through the Redis port (`connection` or `client`), not a Bun client.
  - `styx routes:generate` names anonymous default controllers after their file; `styx create` pins `@elysiumjs/*` packages to the versions it was released with; invalid names are reported as Elysium errors.

### Patch Changes

- [#7](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/7) [`e9c3d98`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/e9c3d98dd2714b69100215f7c8a80046da463148) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Elysium runs on Elysia 2 (`elysia@^2.0.0-rc.1`), with TypeBox 1 (`typebox`), `@elysia/openapi` and `@elysia/opentelemetry`.

  Breaking:

  - `TSchema` and `Static` are re-exported from `typebox` instead of `@sinclair/typebox`; `Value` comes from `typebox/value` and `Value.Errors()` returns an array.
  - `Application.onError()` receives a `ServerError` (exported from core). Elysia now names its errors in kebab case; the default error response keeps the upper snake case names (`VALIDATION`, `NOT_FOUND`, `UNKNOWN` for other errors).
  - `AppHttpContext` is a plain interface with `decorator`, `store` and `derive` records (Elysia 2 renamed `resolve` to `derive`).
  - Websocket controllers install Elysia's `websocket()` capability themselves.

  A module or controller `onRequest` middleware that answers now stops the request: Elysia 2 ignores values returned from a transform hook, so the response is thrown as a status and sent as is, without going through `onError`.

  `mnemosyne` builds date columns with `t.Codec` (TypeBox 1 dropped `Transform`). `argus` traces every route of the app it is installed on and ends each span once, keeping the error status when the request failed.
