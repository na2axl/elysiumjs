Commands, outbox, authentication and multi-step flows, on Bun, Node.js and Cloudflare Workers.

Added:

- `@elysiumjs/moirai`: commands and queries declared with `@Moirai.command()` and `@Moirai.query()`, run with `Commands.execute` and `Queries.ask`. Inputs are validated (400 problem), `authorize` refuses with a 403 problem, commands run in a unit of work and retry transient failures, idempotent commands replay their response for a repeated key (428 without a key, 422 for a key reused with another input), and `serializeBy` runs calls with the same key one after the other. `Outbox.enqueue` writes effects that relay once the unit of work commits, to `@Moirai.effect()` handlers, with a backoff and dead rows; `Outbox.sweep` relays what is due; `Inbox.once` processes a message once per consumer. `@elysiumjs/moirai/heracles` adds `job()`, an effect that dispatches a Heracles job. Memory stores for tests.
- Postgres stores for moirai (`@elysiumjs/mnemosyne-drizzle/moirai`): `moiraiTables(schema?)`, `DrizzleIdempotencyStore`, `DrizzleOutboxStore` (claims with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`), `DrizzleInboxStore` and `PgAdvisoryLock`.
- `@elysiumjs/themis`: password hashing (argon2id on Bun, PBKDF2 everywhere, scrypt on `@elysiumjs/themis/scrypt`), JWT through jose, API keys, signed URLs, sessions (memory, Redis, Workers KV, or an encrypted cookie), `@Auth()` with session, JWT and API key guards (401 problem), picked by name through `AuthMiddleware.guards()` of core middleware, CSRF protection, TOTP and backup codes, OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect clients with PKCE through oauth4webapi, and passkeys through SimpleWebAuthn.
- `@elysiumjs/ariadne`: multi-step flows as controllers: `@Flow.controller()` adds the start and state routes, each `@Flow.step()` method is a route that takes the `@Http.*()` parameter decorators, and `@Flow.state()` / `@Flow.context()` inject the flow. Replay of a repeated step id, refused steps that keep their state, back steps, guest and user owners, a flow that ends when `next` gives no step, and a memory store set by `AriadneModule.with({ store })`.
- `@elysiumjs/ariadne-redis`: `RedisFlowStore`, whose claims and commits are atomic Lua scripts run with `EVAL`, which Upstash runs too.
- `@elysiumjs/ariadne-workers`: `FlowStoreObject`, a Durable Object flow store, and `durableFlowStore(binding)`.
