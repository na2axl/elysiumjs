Repositories take a `RowKey`, a scalar id or an object: `DrizzleRepository` finds rows by the table's primary key, composite keys included, or by the columns named in `DrizzleRepository(model, { key })`, and throws `RepositoryKeyError` for a key that does not match. `list(query, scope)` and `count(query, scope)` take an extra condition. The moirai-drizzle stores accept tables in a domain's own schema with extra columns and another primary key (`StoreTable<T>`).

Pages and page schemas are marked so that interceptors can render them (`Query.isPage()`, `Query.paginationOf()`, `Query.pageSchemaPagination()`, `Query.itemSchemaOf()`). `paginate()` of repositories is deprecated.

Because the generated routes read the parameter's type, clients get typed query keys. Core re-exports TypeBox's `TOptional` and `TString` types.

### Minor Changes

- [#7](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/7) [`e9c3d98`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/e9c3d98dd2714b69100215f7c8a80046da463148) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Elysium runs on Elysia 2 (`elysia@^2.0.0-rc.1`), with TypeBox 1 (`typebox`), `@elysia/openapi` and `@elysia/opentelemetry`.

  Breaking:

  - `TSchema` and `Static` are re-exported from `typebox` instead of `@sinclair/typebox`; `Value` comes from `typebox/value` and `Value.Errors()` returns an array.
  - `Application.onError()` receives a `ServerError` (exported from core). Elysia now names its errors in kebab case; the default error response keeps the upper snake case names (`VALIDATION`, `NOT_FOUND`, `UNKNOWN` for other errors).
  - `AppHttpContext` is a plain interface with `decorator`, `store` and `derive` records (Elysia 2 renamed `resolve` to `derive`).
  - Websocket controllers install Elysia's `websocket()` capability themselves.

  A module or controller `onRequest` middleware that answers now stops the request: Elysia 2 ignores values returned from a transform hook, so the response is thrown as a status and sent as is, without going through `onError`.

  `mnemosyne` builds date columns with `t.Codec` (TypeBox 1 dropped `Transform`). `argus` traces every route of the app it is installed on and ends each span once, keeping the error status when the request failed.

- [#19](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/19) [`6789879`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/678987976ecfd46b534b65276e0de3f448977562) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Domain errors as classes with a code, returned as values.

  - `DomainError` is an Elysia `HTTPError`. Each error is a class made with `DomainError.for(code, status)`, which keeps its code and status as literal types, with `errors`, `retryAfterSeconds` (served as `retryAfter` and the Retry-After header) and extensions.
  - Ready-made errors: `BadRequestError`, `ValidationFailedError`, `UnauthenticatedError`, `ForbiddenError`, `NotFoundError` and `ConflictError`.
  - `ProblemCatalogue`, extended through declaration merging, lists the codes of an application; once it has keys, `DomainError.for()` takes only those and `ELYSIUM_PROBLEM_CODES`.
  - Every problem carries `code`, `requestId` (from `problems.requestId`, a valid `x-request-id` header, or a random UUID) and `instance`. Its `type` is the kebab-case slug of the code, under `problems.typeBase`.
  - Errors as values: a handler, a flow step, `UnitOfWork.run()` or a `@Transactional()` method that returns a DomainError rolls back and sends or returns it like a thrown one. `Commands.execute()` and `Queries.ask()` return the DomainError that refused the call, and a returned error joins the route's response type for typed clients.

- [#13](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/13) [`1ea417e`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/1ea417e3583250bc2f975d795f398b7ff736115d) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Hardening of the runtimes, the container and the CLI, checked by a conformance suite that runs on Bun, Node.js and workerd.

  Breaking changes:

  - `Runtime` gains the required `argv()`, `write(stream, text)` and `terminal()` members: core reaches the host's arguments, output streams and terminal only through the runtime. Custom runtimes must implement them.
  - The third parameter of `InteractsWithConsole.write` is now `'stdout' | 'stderr'`.
  - The WebSocket options are narrowed to `idleTimeout`, `maxPayloadLength` and `perMessageDeflate`, and the `bun` WebSocket types are replaced by `ElysiumWebSocket`.
  - Redis connections are `RedisConnection`s, a port any Redis client can implement, instead of `Bun.RedisClient`.
  - `styx create @scope/name` creates the project in `name/`, and refuses project and module names with upper-case letters.
  - Queue handlers no longer reject the batch: after the handlers ran, each message is acked or retried on its own. `@Workers.queue(name, { each: true })` receives one message at a time, so a failure retries only that message.

  Fixes:

  - Request-scoped services are destroyed when the request ends, also on failure, and an async `onInit` is awaited. A second dispose of a request scope waits for the one in progress, so a Worker's `waitUntil` covers an async `onDestroy`.
  - A failed module or service `onInit` no longer breaks later requests: the boot is retried, and the module's event listeners are unwired.
  - `@elysiumjs/runtime-node` serves through `node:http`, keeping the Host header authoritative.
  - `styx create` validates names before creating files, ships `.gitignore`, declares the dependencies of created projects and imports their default controllers.

- [#14](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/14) [`0956186`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/0956186db0ca5a83c0a6636aeb2a4c81a0033de4) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - The request pipeline: problem details, exception filters, interceptors, typed configuration, HTTP security options and an HTTP test client, checked on Bun, Node.js, workerd and AOT-compiled Workers.

  Breaking changes:

  - Error responses are RFC 9457 problem details (`application/problem+json`). Request validation errors answer 422 with an `errors` list of JSON pointers (`problems.validationStatus: 400` keeps 400). Server errors only show their message and stack in development. Thrown statuses (`c.status(...)`) are sent as they are.
  - Client errors (4xx) are no longer reported to `onError`, the `elysium:error` event or the trace.
  - `Runtime.serve` may return a handle with `close()`, which the application calls on shutdown.
  - Request bodies are limited to 1 MiB by default (`http.bodyLimit`), also when chunked.
  - The environment schema is validated when the app is built or run, with every error reported at once, instead of in the constructor.

  Features:

  - `DomainError`, with `status`, `type`, `title`, `detail` and extensions, and shortcuts such as `DomainError.notFound()`.
  - Exception filters (`@Catch()`, `filters` on routes, controllers, modules and the app) and interceptors (`interceptors` on the same levels), with `TimingInterceptor`, `TransformInterceptor` and mnemosyne's `CacheInterceptor`.
  - Typed configuration: `Secret` values, module `envSchema`s merged into the app's, `InvalidEnvironmentError`.
  - `http` options: CORS, security headers, body limits and trusted proxies (`ctx.ip`). Runtimes report the client address through `clientAddress`.
  - `createTestingHttpApp` and `createHttpClient` send requests to an app in memory, with `expectStatus()`.

  Fixes:

  - App-level `onRequest` middlewares run in the request scope.
  - On Workers, the request scope of a streamed response is disposed when the body ends, not when `fetch` returns.
  - `KeyvWorkersKV.clear()` stays within an operation budget (`maxOperations`).
  - The Node.js bridge treats a destroyed socket as a client abort.
  - Heracles performance metrics report through the Redis port (`connection` or `client`), not a Bun client.
  - `styx routes:generate` names anonymous default controllers after their file; `styx create` pins `@elysiumjs/*` packages to the versions it was released with; invalid names are reported as Elysium errors.

- [#15](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/15) [`fbcc7da`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/fbcc7dad127db29da42e7a4a5c2124966731cd88) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Resources, queries, units of work and rate limits.

  Breaking:

  - A route with a `response` schema serializes its handler result through it: fields the schema does not declare are dropped, a `Date` becomes an ISO string (`YYYY-MM-DD` for `format: 'date'`), and an object with `toJSON()` becomes what it returns. Set `serialize: false` on a route to send the result as it is.

  Added:

  - `Resource.hidden(schema)` marks a field that never reaches responses nor the OpenAPI document. `Resource.serialize()` and `Resource.project()` are exported for use outside routes.
  - Sparse fieldsets: `?fields=id,title` keeps only those fields of an object, of each item of an array, or of each item of a `data` array. An unknown or hidden field answers a 400 problem.
  - Rate limits with `@RateLimit({ window, max, key?, store?, name? })` on routes and controllers (`@RateLimit(false)` turns one off), and a default limit and store in the app's `rateLimit` option, with fixed windows. Responses carry `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining`, `RateLimit-Reset` and `RateLimit-Policy`; a client over the limit gets a 429 problem with `Retry-After`. Counts are kept by a `RateLimitStore`: `MemoryRateLimitStore` (core), `RedisRateLimitStore` (`@elysiumjs/redis`) or `WorkersRateLimitStore` over a Cloudflare rate limiting binding (`@elysiumjs/runtime-workers`), which only decides whether a hit is over the limit, so its responses carry no `RateLimit-Reset`.
  - `ModelResource(model, { hidden, pick, omit, extend })` (`@elysiumjs/mnemosyne`) builds a response schema from a model.
  - `Query.define(model, spec)` declares the filters (`filter[field][op]=value`), sorts, page size and cursor a list accepts; `Query.schema()` gives its query schema, `Query.parse()` turns a request query into a `ParsedQuery` and answers a 400 problem with a pointer per mistake, and `Query.page()` / `Query.pageSchema()` build cursor pages (`{ data, nextCursor }`).
  - `DrizzleRepository.list(query)` and `count(query)` run a `ParsedQuery` with keyset pagination (`@elysiumjs/mnemosyne-drizzle`), and `compileQuery()` gives its `where` and `orderBy`.
  - Units of work: `UnitOfWork.run()` and the `@Transactional()` method decorator run work in one transaction, and `UnitOfWork.afterCommit()` / `afterRollback()` defer work, such as sending a message, until the outermost transaction has ended. `transactional` routes open a unit of work too.

- [#12](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/pull/12) [`98a16aa`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/98a16aae889d46f7a9fb5573188f4cbe3629dd3b) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - `createWorker(app)` from `@elysiumjs/runtime-workers` builds an application and returns the handlers a Cloudflare Worker exports: `fetch` serves the routes, `queue` hands each batch to the service methods marked `@Workers.queue(name)`, and `scheduled` calls the methods marked `@Workers.cron(expression)`. Each invocation runs with its own env and execution context: `Workers.env()`, `Workers.context()` and `Workers.binding(name)` read them, and `WorkersModule` provides them, and the bindings it lists, as request-scoped services injected with `@Workers.inject(name)`. `KeyvWorkersKV` stores mnemosyne caches in a KV namespace. `bun run check:wrangler` runs a sample Worker in `wrangler dev`.

  `MnemosyneModule` takes other Keyv stores in `cache.stores`, read with `Cache.store(name)`.

  `styx build --target workers` (Hephaestus `hephaestus:build --target workers`, `WorkersBuilder`) bundles a Worker with its routes compiled ahead of time and refuses a bundle that generates code at runtime.

  In core, `Application.boot()` initialises the modules once, for hosts that handle more than requests; `Kernel.serviceClasses(node)` lists the service classes of a module; console output falls back to `console` where the host has no output streams; and a singleton depending on a request-scoped service throws `ScopeMismatchError` even when it is built outside a request.

### Patch Changes

Environment variables, timers, the HTTP server, process exit and shutdown signals now come from a `Runtime` set with the new `runtime` option of `@Application.register()` or with `Runtime.use()`. Runtimes ship as packages, each exporting `runtime`: `@elysiumjs/runtime-bun`, `@elysiumjs/runtime-node` and `@elysiumjs/runtime-workers` (which also exports `createRuntime({ env })`).

  Breaking: an application needs a runtime (add `runtime` from `@elysiumjs/runtime-bun`), and `Redis` and `RedisModule` moved from core to the new `@elysiumjs/redis` package, which also accepts a `client` factory for runtimes without `Bun.RedisClient`.

  Console colours are plain ANSI codes instead of `Bun.color`, `node:readline` is loaded only when a prompt runs, and core's dist is built for the `node` target so `node:` imports keep their prefix. `check:runtime` scripts in core and runtime-workers fail when their bundles touch the `Bun` global.

  `create-elysium` gets a runtime step: it installs the chosen runtime package and sets it in the generated app. Bun is selectable today; Node.js and Cloudflare Workers are listed as coming later.

It carries the framework's own signals (`elysium:error`, app and server lifecycle, heracles queue events) and in-process listeners.

### Minor Changes

- [`5fef4a7`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/5fef4a7199f502fc4fe035299e7670739459a108) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Fix tenant isolation, transactions and query caching in the database layer.

  Breaking changes:

  - `TenantMiddleware.validateTenant()` now rejects every tenant unless you override it, and tenant identifiers must match `TENANT_ID_PATTERN` (1 to 63 ASCII letters, digits, `_` or `-`, not starting with `pg_` and other than `information_schema`, in any case) before it is called. Requests that send any other tenant now fail with `Invalid tenant`. Requests without a tenant still resolve to `public` on `SimpleTenantMiddleware`. To migrate, check the tenant against your own data:

    ```ts
    class OrganizationMiddleware extends SimpleTenantMiddleware {
    	protected async validateTenant(tenant: string): Promise<boolean> {
    		return Organization.exists(tenant);
    	}
    }
    ```

  - `getTenantSchema()`, `registerTenantSchema()` and `wrapTenantSchema()` throw on tenant identifiers that do not match `TENANT_ID_PATTERN`.
  - `setConnectionTenant()` is removed. It set the tenant on a pooled connection for the whole session, so the tenant leaked to other requests. Use `withRLS()`, or `Database.transaction()` in RLS mode, which scope the tenant to a transaction.
  - `RepositoryInterface.update()` and `delete()`, and the `DrizzleRepository` implementations, return `null` when no row has the id. They returned `undefined` while typed as a row. `DrizzleRepository` also requires a model whose table has an `id` column.
  - `@transactional` handlers run through the `db.transaction` service that `DrizzleModule` provides (its name is exported by `@elysiumjs/core` as `DATABASE_TRANSACTION_SERVICE`, and still re-exported by `@elysiumjs/mnemosyne`). A transactional handler without a database module now fails with an error naming the service.
  - `@transactional` generator handlers commit only when the whole stream was sent. A stream closed early, or whose client disconnects (even while the handler is waiting), rolls back.
  - In RLS mode, a transaction is bound to one tenant for its whole life: the tenant set (with a transaction-local `set_config`) when `Database.transaction()`, a `@transactional` handler, `withRLS()` or `withIsolation()` opens it, from the explicit tenant or the current one (`public` when there is none). Work that finds a transaction open on its connection (`withRLS()`, `withIsolation()`, `Database.transaction()`, repository calls) joins it only when its tenant is the transaction's tenant, and throws `TenantMismatchError` otherwise, without running anything: the tenant of an open transaction never changes. Inside a transaction, `Database.getConnection()` only returns it to work for its tenant (the current tenant, or `public`), and throws `TenantMismatchError` otherwise, so raw queries never run for another tenant; queries on the `tx` handle a callback received run as the transaction's tenant. Work for several tenants, such as an admin fan-out, must use one `withRLS()` per tenant outside any transaction, not nested in one.
  - In RLS mode, each repository call made outside a transaction runs in its own transaction bound to the current tenant: `BEGIN`, `set_config` of the tenant, the query, `COMMIT`. These calls do not use the query cache, since the cache is bypassed inside transactions. Group calls in `Database.transaction()` or `withRLS()` to share one transaction.
  - In RLS mode, code running without a tenant in context (background jobs, CLI commands, scripts) is scoped to the `public` tenant. Set the tenant with `withTenant(tenant, () => ...)` around the work (repository calls and `Database.transaction()` then use it), or with `withRLS(tenant, (tx) => ...)`.
  - `migration:run` validates `--tenant` against `TENANT_ID_PATTERN`. Without a terminal it no longer creates a missing schema: pass `--create-schema` (which also skips the question in a terminal), or it fails.
  - Query cache keys start with the connection name, and each connection has its own cache transaction scope. When several applications or environments share one cache store and use the same connection names for different databases, set `cache: { prefix }` on each connection: the prefix comes before the connection name in every key (empty by default).
  - `DrizzleDatabaseCache` keys and values changed: entries written by earlier versions are ignored. The default TTL of cached queries (including with `cache: true`) is now 60 seconds instead of 1 second, and is set with `cache: { ttl }` in seconds.
  - `Cache.memory` keeps a separate LRU per tag namespace, so `lruSize` applies to each namespace.

  Fixes and additions:

  - In RLS mode, repository operations outside a transaction run in one bound to the current tenant, through the strategy's `withIsolation()`. Transactions opened with `Database.transaction()` or by `@transactional` handlers set the tenant variable when they open. `withIsolation()` and `withRLS()` expose their transaction to repositories and `Database.getConnection()`. `TenantMismatchError` is exported.
  - `Database.transaction(callback, connection?)` opens a transaction and registers it for the callback. When a transaction is already open on the same connection, the callback joins it (no savepoint: an error rolls back the whole transaction); in RLS mode only if the current tenant is the transaction's tenant (see above). Transactions are tracked by connection, so every name of a connection (`default` and the name it aliases) sees them, and named connections take part in transactions. `Database.getBaseConnection()`, `Database.inTransaction()` and `Database.runInTransaction()` are added. The `db:tx` context entry is still set for the default connection.
  - `@transactional` generator handlers keep their transaction open until the stream ends, then commit (or roll back if the handler throws). They previously committed before running and failed with `generator.next is not a function`. Generator handlers also see the request context (`tenant`, `http:context`).
  - The query cache is scoped to the connection and the current tenant, is shared correctly by several app instances (table versions stored in the cache), is not read or written inside transactions, and invalidates the tables a transaction changed once it commits. A result is only stored when no mutation happened since its query started, including when concurrent queries of the same key finish out of order. Cached queries honour Drizzle's `ex`, `px`, `exat`, `pxat` and `keepTtl` options.
  - Cache namespaces (`Cache.redis.tags(...)`, `Cache.memory.tags(...)`) no longer overwrite each other: reads, deletes and `clear()` stay within their namespace.
  - `getSessionTenant()` reads the Bun SQL result correctly, and `getCurrentTenant()` works without an application instance (for example under `Application.testing`).
  - `migration:run` takes an advisory lock per tenant, adds a unique index on `elysium_migrations.name` (also to existing tables), finds the migrations from the project root (`.elysiumrc`), sets the `search_path` for the transaction only, asks before opening the transaction whether to create a missing schema, and always closes its client. Existing duplicate migration names must be removed before the unique index can be created.
  - `migration:generate` only removes `"public".` qualifiers from the migration it generates, and leaves string literals, comments and dollar-quoted bodies (`DO` blocks, functions) untouched.
  - `DatabaseDriver.createConnection()` receives the connection name as an optional second argument.
  - `KeyvRedis` deletes with a single `UNLINK` (or `DEL`) per call or batch and reports failed deletes in `clear()` as `error` events.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`3625883`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/3625883dba92f1596e7444ee52f9399d8e9b049f) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Drop the `reflect-metadata` dependency. Decorator metadata now lives in a small store in `@elysiumjs/core`, exported as `Metadata` (`define`, `get`, `getOwn`, `has`). Use it instead of `Reflect.defineMetadata` and `Reflect.getMetadata` to read or write Elysium metadata.

  Apps no longer need `import 'reflect-metadata'` in their entrypoint, and generated projects leave it out. Keep `emitDecoratorMetadata` enabled: `@Service.inject()` and `@Command.arg()` still infer types from it. An app that loads `reflect-metadata` for another library keeps working; Elysium also reads the types stored there.

- [`07236b3`](https://github.com/na2axl/elysiumjs/commit/07236b386c2506590d74e8753ce847c1e184b3ee) Thanks [@na2axl](https://github.com/na2axl)! - Introduce the module system. Modules are now the only way to register anything in an Elysium.js app. This is a breaking change with no compatibility layer.

  Breaking changes:

  - `@Module.register()` takes `imports`, `services`, `exports`, `controllers`, `commands`, `jobs`, `prefix` and `env`. Services are private to their module unless exported (or global). The `beforeRegister` and `afterRegister` hooks are replaced by `onInit`, `onServe` and `onDestroy`.
  - Configurable modules are bound with `with()`, for example `HermesModule.with({ level: 'debug' })`. `with()` accepts an object or a function.
  - Decorators only record metadata. Importing a file no longer registers commands, services or event wiring, and the side-effect imports of the packages are removed. List commands, jobs and services in the module that owns them.
  - `@Application.register()` no longer takes `database`, `redis`, `wamp` or `'elysium:hermes'`/`'elysium:cerberus'` keys. Use `DrizzleModule`, `RedisModule`, `WampModule`, `HermesModule` and `CerberusModule`. Package plugins are replaced by modules: add `SentryModule` instead of the `plugin()` function. `plugins` still accepts plain Elysia plugin factories.
  - Constructing an `Application` no longer runs it. Use `await App.start()`; `Application.testing()` boots a module graph for tests. The `styx` binary loads `src/app.ts` (or `index.ts`) and starts the exported application, so a project entry no longer needs to import commands.
  - The job system of core (`Job`, `Worker`, `WorkerPool`, `commandWork`) is removed. `@elysiumjs/heracles` is the only job system: extend its `Job`, list jobs in a module's `jobs`, declare queues with `HeraclesModule.with({ queues })`, and dispatch with `Heracles.dispatch()`.
  - `@elysiumjs/styx` ships `StyxModule`, active in development only. The `migration:generate` and `migration:run` commands move to `DrizzleModule` and are available in production.
  - `@elysiumjs/mnemosyne` ships `MnemosyneModule` for its caches (`redis: false` or `memory: false` opts out). `DrizzleModule` imports it.
  - New modules: `HephaestusModule`, `ArgusModule` (`serviceName` is required), `SentryModule` (needs a `dsn` or `SENTRY_DSN`) and `CerberusModule` (`getSubject` is required).
  - Module and service code throws typed errors (for example `InvalidModuleConfigError`) instead of exiting the process. `Application.run()` prints them and exits; command `run()` methods may still exit, and package plugin factories are unchanged.
  - `Application.register` merges subclass props over the parent's (own props, then own metadata, then parent, then defaults), and concatenates `modules` parent first. Previously defaults and parent values won, so `openapi` could not be enabled.
  - `Heracles.dispatch` starts a stopped queue on first use, so producers no longer start queues. `Queue.start()` is idempotent.
  - `create-elysium` generates apps that use modules, and adds Sentry and Hephaestus to the `modules` list.
  - `@Event.on`/`@Event.once` method listeners on classes in a loaded module's `services` or `controllers` are wired by the kernel and run in their module's context. Jobs, commands and middlewares are not wired, and an instance listener on a class that is not a service throws `EventListenerNotSupportedError`. Listeners on classes not listed in a loaded module no longer fire.
  - New typed errors: `CircularDependencyError` (services that depend on each other, in sync and async resolution), `DuplicateModuleNameError` (two different module classes sharing a name; module scopes and config tokens are name based) and `EventListenerNotSupportedError`.
  - Lazy boot contract: a CLI command initialises only its own module and that module's imports. Sync helpers such as `Database.getConnection()` work when the owning module's `onInit` is synchronous; otherwise they throw `ServiceNotReadyError` naming the module. Use `await Service.resolve()` or set `static boot = true` on the command.
